# Korean chatting is now available during the game play
# Mr. 게렛garrett (javalia) completed his great work using plug-in of "minglx".
# Korean letter of "테스트" is shown when you input ",xptmxm", using the delimiter ","
# However, you should not click the Korean-English switch key.
# This is now available in quakelivekorea server and in qlrace.com KR server.
# It means plug-in of "minglx" is necessary in other servers.
# (Just think that you cannot use this function, because other servers will not apply this plug-in.) 

# It might make you confused when you would see written words in English letter, not in Korean letter. 
# In addition, you would find ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, or etc. when Caps Lock is applied, so turn off it.

# If your quakelive doesn't seem to show Korean letters, it will be helpful to apply some files through the following link.
